Bugs:

* Repo name misspelled(this is what happens when you rush)
* Steam overlay does not work - This is a problem with the game. Launching the regular .exe from outside steam does not activate the overlay. Probably won't be fixed unless the game is patched. "For the Steam Overlay to work it must be injected before the renderer (DirectX/OpenGL) gets initialized. injection is done in SteamAPI.Init(). It works when launched through Steam as Steam will always inject the overlay as the process starts."
* May not work with some antiviruses
* Button inputs(such as opening doors) may not work correctly? Some users are having problems
* Some cutscenes may be broken
