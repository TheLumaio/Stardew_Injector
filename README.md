#### New debug menu option. Enable this to access the in-game debug menu. Press F8 to open up a console. You can view a list of commands [here](https://github.com/kevinmurphy678/Stardew_Injector/blob/master/DebugCommands.md)

# How to use:

* Download the latest release here https://github.com/kevinmurphy678/Stawdew_Injector/releases 
* Extract the contents to your game directory
* Edit the configuration file with the settings you wish to use
* Run Stardew_Injector.exe



### Bugs:

* Steam overlay does not work - This is a problem with the game. Launching the regular .exe from outside steam does not activate the overlay. Probably won't be fixed unless the game is patched. "For the Steam Overlay to work it must be injected before the renderer (DirectX/OpenGL) gets initialized. injection is done in SteamAPI.Init(). It works when launched through Steam as Steam will always inject the overlay as the process starts."
* Some anti viruses may block the program from running the game.
* Faster movement speed or tweaked diagonal movement *may* cause cutscenes or interactions to break
